# Project Structure

Creating dedicated folders for various parts of your application can lead to better organization and clarity. By separating concerns into different folders, you can quickly identify and navigate to specific files when working on different features or fixing bugs.

When structuring your Vue.js project, consider organizing your files based on the MVC architecture.

For example:

```sh
├── src
│   ├── components // Reusable components
│   │   ├── Login
│   ├── services // API requests
│   │   ├── Auth
│   ├── views // Top-level views or page components
│   ├── store // Store-related files
│   ├── utils // Utility functions or helper modules
│   ├── types // Shared types across the application
│   ├── composables // Reusable logic using Vue Composition API
├── public
│   ├── assets // Static assets like images, fonts, and stylesheets
```

- **Organize components hierarchically** - per page or group child components in a folder
- **Use clear naming conventions** - to prevent naming collisions and ensure a well-organized codebase, consider using meaningful names for modules and components.

By following this structure, you can maintain a clean and scalable codebase, making it easier to manage and collaborate on your project.
