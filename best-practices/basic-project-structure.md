# Project Structure

A well-structured project is key to maintainability, scalability, and efficient collaboration. Proper organization ensures clarity and makes it easier to locate and update code when needed.

Here is a guide to structuring your Vue.js project effectively, using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern as inspiration:

### Suggested Directory Structure
```sh
├── src
│   ├── components            # Reusable components
│   │   ├── tests             # Unit tests for individual components
│   │   ├── auth              # Folder to group components and related files
│   │   │   ├── LoginForm.vue # Example of a component
│   ├── services              # API requests and service modules
│   │   ├── auth.service.ts   # Handles authentication-related API calls
│   ├── views                 # Top-level views or page components
│   │   ├── HomeView.vue      # Example of a top-level page component
│   ├── store                 # Store-related files
│   │   ├── auth.store.ts     # Example of a store module
│   ├── utils                 # Utility functions or helper modules
│   │   ├── formatDate.ts     # Example of a utility function
│   ├── types                 # Shared types and interfaces across the application
│   │   ├── user.d.ts         # Example of type definitions
│   ├── composables           # Reusable logic using Vue Composition API
│   │   ├── useFileUpload.ts  # Example of a composable
│   ├── tests                 # Integration and end-to-end tests
├── public
│   ├── assets                # Static assets like images, fonts, and stylesheets
```

### Key Guidelines
- **Organize components hierarchically** - Group components logically based on the application's structure. For instance, in a multi-page application, components for a Dashboard feature (e.g., DashboardHeader.vue, DashboardSidebar.vue, DashboardContent.vue) can reside in a components/Dashboard folder, while shared components like Button.vue or Modal.vue stay in the root components folder.
- **Use clear naming conventions** - To prevent naming collisions and ensure a well-organized codebase, adopt meaningful and descriptive names for modules, components, and files. For example, use UserProfileCard.vue instead of a generic Card.vue, or AuthService.js instead of Service.js. This improves code readability and helps developers quickly understand the purpose of each file.
- **Leverage Modularity** - Structure your code to allow independent modules to handle specific tasks. For example, split services into separate files by domain (e.g., user.service.js for user-related API calls and order.service.js for order-related ones). Additionally, group reusable logic in composables to keep your codebase clean and organized.

By adopting this structure and adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase that is easy to navigate and work on collaboratively.
